#### Hangman is a popular word guessing game where the player attempts to build a missing word by guessing one letter at a time. If a player guesses the word within the chances then he wins.   After a certain number of incorrect guesses, the game ends and the player loses. The game process is shown by a sketch of a man being hanged
